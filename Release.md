Please see https://wiki.milosolutions.com/index.php/Qt_project_documentation

This file should contain all the information needed to build the project (all
platforms), prepare release packages (installers, docs, icons, etc.), and how
to share it all with the client.

You can distribute this info over several files if prefer. But at least leave
some pointers (where to look) here.
